Hacking CMakeQt
---------------

Hack as you wish. If you want your stuff to be merged, send a patch, in unified format (refer diff -Naur or git format patch -o <HEAD etc...>) to: rohityadav89 AT gmail.com

Copyright
---------
To comply with the GPL, add your name, email address & the year to the top of
any file that you edit. If you bring in code or files from elsewhere, make sure
its GPL-compatible and to put the authors name, email & copyright year to the
top of those files. Anyway, do whatever feels right ;)

Thanks, now have fun!
